The Flower Pot Application includes a Windows Example for programmatically creating a WiFi connection. Additionally, there are pages added for more functionality, including a start page, a personal information page, a dashboard, and the start of a tag setup page.

The Project is split up into different tiers: A Presentation Tier, which includes all of the Pages that the User will see, A BusinessLogic Tier, which includes all of the logic that is used within those pages,and a Data Tier, which has not yet been included, but will be when data persistence is implemented.

Most of the code is undocumented, but as more code is implemented, there will be comments describing what each fragment accomplishes.
