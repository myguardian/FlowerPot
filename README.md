The Flower Pot Application includes a Windows Example for programmatically creating a WiFi connection. Additionally, 
there are pages added for additinal functionality, including a start page, a personal information page, a dashboard, 
and the start of a tag setup page.

Most of the code is undocumented, but as more code isimplemented, there will be comments describing what each fragment accomplishes.
